# Shift-scheduling-under-stochastic-demand
This project presents a shift scheduling (optimisation) method for service systems with limited working hours and that faces with under stochastic and non-stationary demand.

The fast delivery market has been growing critically over the past years ([12]). Such service systems with limited opening hours face with stochastic and non-stationary demand. In this context, determining staffing requirements is a challenge. However, up to date, shift scheduling with non-stationary stochastic demand has received limited attention in the academic literature. Much research has focused on scheduling problems in call centers (see, e.g, [1], [2] or [3]). In this project, fast delivery shift scheduling problems with service-level constraints are formulated as mixed-integer programs and investigated through a simulation-based branch-and-bound approach.
